The purpose of this project is to stream line creation of new users accounts locally on a system and within Active Directory.If you can provide better, or just more efficient ways by all means please do so! I have specific issues setup with what I'm looking for so please try to follow those issues. If you can provide some sort of addition not listed as one of the issues you still can. You just need to articulate what you've done and your code needs to reflect that. 

Please see the Digital Ocean guidelines here https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards
