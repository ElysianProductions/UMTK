This program was written to make my life easier. It's a way to standardize the creation process of new users accounts. 
There is a defined methodoly that you can see bvy either reading the code, or this file. The README file is not traditionally a pdf. 
I'm doing it this way to illustrate a more indepth documentation process. 

NOTE: For information regarding the C++ variation; please see the doxgen generated documentation for that program. While 
      things written in this document may hjold true for portions of that software they in no way represent the overall body of work.
