In order for NSIS to see the license text you need to copy the GPLv3.txt file to the root directory of the folder you're targetting with NSIS.
In order for NSIS to see the Icon you need to copy paste your image icon to the root directory of the folder you're targetting with NSIS.
If you change the name of the root directory (you can) you need to append   File /r "C:\BuildDir\umtkqml\QML-UMTK-V1.0\*" so that your new directory name is correct.
